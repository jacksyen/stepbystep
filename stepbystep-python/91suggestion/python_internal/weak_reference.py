Without the explicit call to del,
__del__ is only called at the end of the program,
Counter and/or Count may have already been GC-ed by the time __del__ is
called (the order in which objects are collected is not deterministic).
 The exception means that Counter has already been collected.
You canâ€™t do anything particularly fancy with __del__.
